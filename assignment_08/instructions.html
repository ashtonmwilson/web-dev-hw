        <h1><strong>Fire School</strong></h1>
           <p><dfn>Fire</dfn> is the oxidation of fuel exothermically through the combustion process.<br />
           <cite>Fire</cite>, The article in wikipedia, is a great resource for more knoweldge.</p>

           <p><strong>The Three Threes</strong></p>
            <p> In order to build a fire,<br />
            we are going to need to memorize,<br />
            the <em>three three's</em> of fire building.</p>
        <h2>1s, 2s, 3s</h2>
            <p>If you followed the <a href="../">Supplies List</a><br />
            then you already have these,<br />
            they are the fuel we will use,<br />
            set them aside for now in three piles.</p>
            <p>Feel free to print and laminate the below table as a refrence for kindling sizes.</p>
            <table>
              <caption>1s 2s 3s</caption>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th scope="col">Fuel Size</th>
                 </tr>
                 <tr>
                    <th scope="row">1's</th>
                    <td>pencil Lead</td>
                 </tr>
                 <tr>
                    <th scope="row">2's</th>
                    <td>pencil</td>
                 </tr>
                 <tr>
                    <th scope="row">3's</th>
                    <td>thumb</td>
                 </tr>
              </table>
        <h2>The 3 P's</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Preparedness</li>
            <li>Patience</li>
            <li>Progression</li>
          </ol>
          <p> Not always in this order, these skills will come in practically handy,<br />
            and will lead to an ability to start fires in any condition.</p>
        <h2>The 3 essentials</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Fuel</li>
            <li>Oxygen</li>
            <li><abbr title="Or ignition.">Heat</abbr></li>
          </ul>
          <p>

        </p>
          <p>This may seem <dfn>redundant</dfn> as it is also the supplies list,<br />
          however, recognizing and maintaining a <strong>balance</strong> between theese<br />
          three things, while building the fire, is <em>essential</em> to success.</p>

            <h1>Getting started, Preperation:</h1>
                <p> In order to start the process we must first select a safe site,<br />
                    out from under trees. Clear any burnable debris away from your fire site,<br />
                    and do your best to use existing pits when available</p>
                    <p>Kneel on one knee (for faster mobility in an emergnecy) over the pit,<br />
                      have your 1s,2s,3s and water within arms reach. Pull out two of the 2s,<br />
                      and place them parrallel to eachother similarly to the image below, creating a trough.<br />
                      Take a solid handfull of 1's and place them at the narrower end of the trough.</p>
                      <img src="../images/trough_fire_technique.jpg" alt="An image of a trough fire" title="image of a man kneeling next to a trough fire technique" width="480" height="360" />
            <h1>Lighting the fire, Patience:</h1>
            <p>Light the match, or lighter, and hold it under the bundle of elevated 1s.<br/>
              Wait patiently as the 1s catch fire. </p>
              <p>Once the ones have a flame that is peaking above them, move on to the final step.</p>
            <h1>Finding the balance, Progression:</h1>
            <p>As the pile of ones becomes a glowing ember in the center, and still has a flame<br />
              peaking, start to add the 2s slowly. Here you have some creative freedom.<br />
              Some people use a Tee Pee formation, others go with the log cabin, either will do.</p>
              <p> What is most important is moving slowly up throught the different sizes of sticks<br />
                in order to feed the fire while increasing the heat. All the while keeping in mind<br />
                the three things a fire needs to thrive: <em>fuel, oxygen, and heat.</em></p>
              <p>While adding sticks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Leave enough room for <strong>oxygen</strong> to pass through.</li>
        <li>Keep the logs close enough to maintain <strong>heat</strong>.</li>
        <li>Add the <strong>sticks/fuel</strong> with intention, knowing where the next one will go.</li>
      </ol>


<p>Remember a healthy and balanced fire is smokeless.</p>

            <h3><strong>SAFTEY PRECAUTIONS:</strong></h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Always have water nearby: a hose, or full five gallon bucket.</li>
                <li>Check your local laws and current fire danger levels.<abbr title="Leave no trace!"> LNT.</abbr></li>
                <li>Keep it small! <q>If a stick is too big to break, it's too big to burn</q></li>
