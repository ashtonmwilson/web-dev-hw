# Assignment 08

 1. Learning Html was a bit dificult, It was a refresher for me, and I was able to use alot of old information I had from previous courses. I am still at a place where I need to constantly refer to the resources to remember what code instances look like.

 2. I am anxious about having one more document to refer to in CSS, and having to move fluidly between the two. It does seem simple enough that I am excited to be able to make the sites look a little less primitive.

 3. For this assignment I reworked an assignment from the last time I took the class, it seems this one most closely matches the previous times I have taken the course.
