# Technical Report

 Learning Html was a bit dificult, It was a refresher for me, and I was able to use alot of old information I had from previous courses. I am still at a place where I need to constantly refer to the resources to remember what code instances look like.

 I am anxious about managing dual code instances in CSS.

 For this assignment I utilized information I already had from previous work, and applied the knoweldge in a format that made sense to me.
