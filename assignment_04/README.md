## Way Back Machine Findings
In the way back machine, I looked into facebook, and found that the website was originally used for connecting people in their work place. I could not tell if this was under the ownership of Zuck. I noticed changes in the UX layout, and design style, as well as changes in the language of the site.

## GIT Module
The GIT Module to me is a revisitation, I am learning how to more seamlessly edit offline, without having to refresh as constantly. With Satelite wifi, this has sped up my work flow. What was dificult was connecting offline creations to online repo's and vice versa. I still do not understand how to create an offline repo in atom, and then push it to be a sub repo in git online.
