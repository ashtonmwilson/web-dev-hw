# Assignment 06

1. I have come across forms when I unsubscribe from email lists. They are usually radio style forms, and they let the emailers know why I am unsubscribing.
2.
  a. A text inpot exists at most logins with email and password.

  b. A selection input exists when selecting the make and model of your car at an auto parts website.

  c. Button inputs exist to sumbit information on a form, like "pay now"

3. My work flow for this wekk was similar to last week in that I started at the assignment page, and refreshed on content I needed to brush up on, primarily using the book. I was only able to access the section 6 of the website through the link below the assignment, rather than through the hamburger drop down on the actual site. not sure why it locked me out.
