# Assignment 02

## Ashton Wilson

I decided to take this class because it is required for my Major. I am also interested in learning html and CSS. I took this class for a third time, because I thought I would be better about procrastination, and time dedication. I am not.

### I hope to learn:

1. How to make a beautifully initeractive website.
2. To take a photoshop mockup, and write code to bring it to life.
3. Fluency in these coding languages, that enables me to learn python, and other widely used languages.
