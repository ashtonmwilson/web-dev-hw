# Assignment 12 Readme
1. my iimaginary client is not so imaginary. Building on week 11's concepts, I chose to use my business. Most of my work comes through word of mouth, and I have not needed a sit yet, but my needs are an conduit for my portfolio, and a way for people to get a feel for the kind of work I do. Ultamitely a place to send people who want to look at something rather than talk to me.
2. display: block; leaves the items in a vertical allignment with no spacing between them. display: inline; moves the items into a horizontal alignment. display: inline-block; puts the items in horizontal alignment with space between each item. (Creating blocks to conatint the items.)
3. For this assignment, I copied and pasted the content I hadfrom last weeks assignment. I had built it based on the lessons rather than the tutorials. Then I thought it might be quicker to use the turtoials only to find that they build on eachother and do not initially match the layed out expectations, in that there is only one css document in the expectations and the tutlorial layed out building on documents with three css pages. So then I abondened the tutorial and moved to the example website, modifying code from it's source to fit my needs, knowing that it would meet most of the requirements.
