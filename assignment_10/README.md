# Assignment 10
###
1. I began this project by copying and pasting older files into the new folder I created, I then proceded to work through the requirements listed in the assignment sheet.

The fonts I chose to use are:
 Inconsolata-Bold and Montserrat-ExtraLight which I found at [Font Pair](https://fontpair.co/). I wanted to use one monospace font. They look professional together and fit the passages; Inconsolata-Bold demonstrates importance, while Montserrat-ExtraLight shows the fragility of the text.

2.A system font

3. Wow! I really sturggled with assigning fonts to specifit areas in this assignment without copying and pasting from the example document. I really dont understand why sometimes fonts can be assigned form one selector in CSS and not form another selector. rather than select both H1 and Pre and assign the fonts uniquely to these different aspects I did end up using the * to select all of the page for Montserrat-ExtraLight and it worked. Never mind, Still could not get Inconsolata to load properly. Ya, at first I could only get one font to work at a time, now neither is working. There has to be a way to just identify that all h1's can be a font.
