  My hair was too short and my US Government glasses were horn-rimmed,
ugly, and all that first winter in school, the other Indian boys chased me from
one comer of the playground to the other. They pushed me down, buried me
in the snow until I couldn't breathe, thought I'd never breathe again.
  They stole my glasses and threw them over my head, around my output-
stretched hands, just beyond my reach, until someone tripped me and sent me
falling again, facedown in the snow.
  I was always falling down; my Indian name was Junior Falls Down. Some-
times it was Bloody Nose or Steal-His-Lunch. Once, it was Cries-Like-a
White-Boy, even though none of us had seen a white boy cry.
  Then it was a Friday morning recess and Frenchy Sijohn threw snowballs
at me while the rest of the Indian boys tortured some other top-yogh-yaught
kid, another weakling. But Frenchy was confident enough to torment me all
by himself, and most days I would have let him.
  But the little warrior in me roared to life that day and knocked Frenchy to
the ground, held his head against the snow, and punched him so hard that my
knuckles and the snow made symmetrical bruises on his face. He almost
looked like he was wearing war paint.
  But he wasn't the warrior. I was. And I chanted <i>It's a good day to die, it's a
good day to die,</i> all the way down to the principal's office.

  Betty Towle, missionary teacher, redheaded and so ugly that no one ever
had a puppy crush on her, made me stay in for recess fourteen days straight.
  <q>Tell me you're sorry,</q> she said.
  <q>Sorry for what?</q> I asked.
  <q>Everything,</q> she said and made me stand straight for fifteen minutes,
eagle-armed with books in each hand. One was a math book; the other was
English. But all I learned was that gravity can be painful.
    For Halloween I drew a picture of her riding a broom with a scrawny cat
on the back. She said that her God would never forgive me for that.
    Once, she gave the class a spelling test but set me aside and gave me a test
designed for junior high students. When I spelled all the words right, she
crumpled up the paper and made me eat it.
  <q>You'll learn respect,</q> she said.
  She sent a letter home with me that told my parents to either cut my
braids or keep me home from class. My parents came in the next day and
dragged their braids across Betty Towle's desk.
  <q>Indians, indians, indians.</q> She said it without capitalization. She called
me <q>indian, indian, indian.</q>
  And I said, Yes, I am. I am Indian. Indian, I am.

  My traditional Native American art career began and ended with my
very first portrait: Stick Indian Taking a Piss in My Backyard.
  As I circulated the original print around the classroom, Mrs. Schluter
intercepted and confiscated my art.
  Censorship, I might cry now. Freedom of expression, I would write in edito-
rials to the tribal newspaper.
  In third grade, though, I stood alone in the corner, faced the wall, and
waited for the punishment to end. I'm still waiting.
