# Assignment 09
###
1. The difference between the types of selectors is their parent child specificity. Universal selectors are the broadest applying to the whole document, and id selectors are the most specific, applying just to an individual element. Class also allows you to identify multiple elements as the same for styling.

2. I chose to use black white and these three colors, I think they really pop together, and I pulled them from a period poster I collaboratively designed for a local event.
  a. Neon pink HEX:#FE0273
  b. Neon blue HEX:#53CEED
  c. Dark Yellow HEX:#FFE401

3. Getting caught up, I returned to the traditionla approach of going through the week's content virst and then revisiting it as I worked through the assignments requirements. I would love for my Assignment 06 to also be considered for color, and styling.
