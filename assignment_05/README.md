#Assignment 04 Readme
1. An HTML document can only have one head and one body tag. the head tag contains information that the user does not see, and controls the document. The body tag contains the guts of the visible document, everything that we see.
2. Structural markup is the bones of the site and dictates the overall formatting. Semantic markup applies to the visual text within the website.
3. Having covered some of these topics before, I started at the assignment page, with atom open. I completed as much of the assignment from memory and copy paste from old assignments. When I got stuck I used the Duckett book and course site search function to solve problems. When complete I pushed to GitHub with GitHub desktop.
